Connect Four is essentially Tic-Tac-Toe on a larger scale. Here are the rules and minimum requirements.
The game is played on a 7-by-6 grid of cells.
Players take turns placing pieces (red or yellow) on the board.
When a player places a piece on the board, he or she does so by choosing a column. The piece is then placed in the first available cell in that column (starting from the bottom of the board).
A player wins if he or she places four consecutive pieces: vertically, horizotnally, or diagonally.
If the board is entirely filled without either player winning, the game ends in a tie.
Remember, these are just the minimum requirements. My suggestion is that you spare no expense in making this game your own. Part of the grading process will be how desirable your game is to your peers. What makes a game desirable? User interface and user experience (affectionately known in the world of software developemnt as UI and UX).
The user interface is how the application looks. This comes down to your structure and style. The user experience is more about the features your game supports, how well they are integrated, and how intuitive the game play is.
Looking for a little inspiration? Here are some cool features you might consider implementing.
Keep score. Let players play multiple games, and keep track of their wins and losses.
Allow players to choose who will go first. Or, alternatively, let the loser of the previous game go first (or randomize this decision if the previous game ended in a tie).
Implement an AI so that players can play against the computer. It would be really cool if players could choose a difficulty level (i.e., easy, medium, hard, expert), and your AI would play accordingly.
Add some animation to your game, so that it looks like the pieces are really sliding down from the top of the board (like they would in real life!).
