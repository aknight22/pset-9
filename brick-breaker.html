//Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game, where the player must use a ball and a paddle to break bricks. Here are the rules and minimum requirements.
The game is played on an open board with a grid of bricks at the top and a paddle at the bottom.
The ball moves continuously, bouncing off the bricks, the walls, and the paddle (and changing directions with each collision).
If the ball collides with a brick, the brick disappears from the board.
If the ball collides with the bottom edge (not the paddle), the game is over.
A player can move the paddle to the left and right with either the mouse or the array keys (or both).
A player wins by breaking all of the bricks on the board.
Remember, these are just the minimum requirements. My suggestion is that you spare no expense in making this game your own. Part of the grading process will be how desirable your game is to your peers. What makes a game desirable? User interface and user experience (affectionately known in the world of software developemnt as UI and UX).
The user interface is how the application looks. This comes down to your structure and style. The user experience is more about the features your game supports, how well they are integrated, and how intuitive the game play is.
Looking for a little inspiration? Here are some cool features you might consider implementing.
Keep score. Let players play multiple games, and keep track of their wins and losses.
Add a difficulty level, which can manifest in several ways. Maybe the paddle is smaller when the difficulty is greater. Maybe the ball moves faster. You might also want to gradually increase the speed of the ball over time.
Give the player a certain number of lives. The game only ends if the player runs out of lives.
Include some power ups in random bricks. When the brick breaks, the power up falls to the bottom and the user needs to catch it with the paddle. The power up can be anything that assists the player: a larger paddle, a bigger or slower ball, or an extra life!
