//The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid of alternating light and dark squares.
//Each player is given 12 pieces (differentiated by color, usually light and dark).
//The pieces are placed on the dark squares.Starting setup where only two rows on the board are free of any pieces.
//Players take turns moving their pieces around the board, with the ultimate goal of capturing all of his or her opponent's pieces.
//Pieces can only move diagonally in one direction, and can only move one square at a time.
//If a diagonally-adjacent square is occupied by an opposing piece (and the next diagonally-adjacent square is unoccupied), a player can jump the opposing piece. This moves your piece, and removes your opponent's piece from the board.
//If, after jumping an opposing piece, another jump is immediately available, the original player can go again.
//If a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, that piece is promoted to a king. Unlike ordinary pieces, a king can move in either direction on the board (including during multiple jumps).
//A player wins if he or she captures all of his or her opponent's pieces.
//If each player has only one piece remaining on the board and 20 moves have transpired, the game ends in a stalemate.
//Remember, these are just the minimum requirements. My suggestion is that you spare no expense in making this game your own. Part of the grading process will be how desirable your game is to your peers. What makes a game desirable? User interface and user experience (affectionately known in the world of software developemnt as UI and UX).
//The user interface is how the application looks. This comes down to your structure and style. The user experience is more about the features your game supports, how well they are integrated, and how intuitive the game play is.
//Looking for a little inspiration? Here are some cool features you might consider implementing.
//Keep score. Let players play multiple games, and keep track of their wins and losses.
//Add square highlighting when selecting a piece to show players what their available moves are on each turn.
//Implement an AI so that players can play against the computer. It would be really cool if players could choose a difficulty level (i.e., easy, medium, hard, expert), and your AI would play accordingly.
